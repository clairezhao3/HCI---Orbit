# Orbit — Implementation Prototypes (Assignment 5)

This repository contains our **implementation prototypes** for the CIS 4000 project **Orbit**, a mobile app that helps users discover nearby events and connect through shared experiences.  

These prototypes demonstrate that our team can implement the key technical features required for our final UI.

---

## Project Overview
**Orbit** allows users to explore live events and local venues through an interactive map interface, share comments with others attending, and receive real-time alerts when activity happens around places they care about.

This assignment demonstrates that our technical foundation — including mapping, commenting, saving, and notifications — works correctly in **React Native**.
